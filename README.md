# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Titanic Dataset

## ðŸ“‹ Task Overview
This repository contains my submission for **Task 5** of the **Data Analyst Internship** program.

**Objective:**
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset (Titanic dataset used here).
- Identify trends, patterns, and anomalies.
- Visualize findings using Python libraries.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded the Titanic dataset (`train.csv`).
2. Checked basic information (`.info()`, `.describe()`, missing values).
3. Performed univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses.
4. Created visualizations:
   - Histograms
   - Boxplots
   - Pairplots
   - Heatmaps
   - Scatterplots
5. Identified correlations and major patterns.
6. Documented observations after each visualization.
7. Summarized final insights.

##  Key Insights
- Majority of survivors were women and children.
- Higher passenger class (Pclass = 1) had a higher survival rate.
- Fare price had significant outliers, indicating a few passengers paid much higher.
- Age had missing values and required handling.
